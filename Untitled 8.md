## 1. Problem Statement

Users sometimes forget to carry the Neo 1 device but still need to capture important conversations. Currently, there is no seamless fallback mechanism to record audio via the mobile app. This gap leads to lost memory opportunities and reduces the perceived reliability of the product.

## 2. Objective

Introduce a fallback recording experience‚Äî**Forget Mode**‚Äîwithin the Neo mobile app that activates when the Neo 1 device is not connected. This mode will:

- Let users record high-importance conversations using the phone microphone.
- Automatically transcribe and generate a memory, similar to Neo 1 workflows.
- Preserve the ‚Äúconnect and forget‚Äù promise by always being ready with a backup.
## 3. Core Functionality

### 3.1 Trigger

- Automatically detect a lack of Neo 1 connection on app launch.
- Show a non-intrusive prompt:¬†**‚ÄúForgot Neo 1?‚Äù**
- Users can also access Forget Mode manually via the settings.
### 3.2 Recording Interface

- Request microphone permissions if not granted.
- Display a simple interface: mic waveform and stop button.
- Visual indicator must show that the mic is on and actively recording.
### 3.3 Audio Handling & Memory Generation

- The memory starts generating on the backend when I press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.
- Transcribe and generate structured memory with tags    
- Display on Home screen & Memory list post-processing.

## 4. UX/UI Requirements

- Show a persistent recording notification while app is backgrounded.
- Provide proactive reminders if user has a calendar event but no connected Neo 1.
- Alert at the start on impact of playing media while recording(the volume is reduced), impact on the battery if the device is transcribing and how phone calls can interrupt the transcribing.
- Handle phone call interruptions with ease using auto-resume capability.

- Has not connected to the app on a weekday
- Around the time the user normally connects the device. Go by the average time they are going to connect
