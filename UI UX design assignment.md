We have attached our current home screen, just below the memory card, we would like to have a feature called Mood Score


We propose 3 key features for this section:
1. Trendline of mood/ vibe score (score out of 100) which is captured as an aggregate for a memory. The score reflects the user and not the overall conversation.
2. Ability for a user to click on an individual score for a particular memory → takes the user to Ask Neo screen which explains the rationale for the score and its breakdown along with feedback.
3. Total time in conversations vs total speaking time by the user
4. Emotion during the latest conversation
5. Ability for a user to clock on this → takes the user to Ask Neo to explain why that emotion, along with feedback on what he/ she did well and what can be improved

Design goals:
1. Create a sense of personalisation and emotional connect with the product → feeling that it is an AI companion
2. Feeling of delight when interacting with the feature
3. Potential to go down a rabbit hole as users interact with the feature and explore other questions to satisfy their curiosity
4. Trust on the numbers/ scores → justify the scores
5. Create user feedback loop (to get metrics on whether they felt the score was accurate or not)
The only success criteria is to improve the stickyness of the app, it is to make them use the app more and build a sense of curiosity.
