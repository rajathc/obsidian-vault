I want to tell u something confidentially… don’t ever tell her and delete the message after reading it. She thinks she can make a fortune out of soap making. I’m trying to tell her if that’s so, she can quit her legal job. The problem is here u r paid very low salary and people can’t match the salary she was getting or expects. Even in other places budget has been a constraint. We are trying to make her understand that she has to have a proper source of income to secure herself n her future. Soap business to establish takes a lot of time, infrastructure, know how etc and catering to a few orders will not yield the desired result. I know people with chemistry background tried to making phenyle n selling it but it flopped after some time and the person who invested a lot of money just lost it . I can’t tell her about such things coz she will misunderstand me. If possible make her realise that she should not waste time only in soap making. There was an offer with low salary but it can’t be helped as here people pay very low salary

I understand what you are trying to say, I agree with what you are speaking as well. I have tried my hand at entrepreneurship; in fact, I had suggested her good and scalable ideas which she can try to do. But she was too afraid to try it out, and I completely understand her. You also need to understand that right now her hopes are very low and she was very dejected until she started making soaps, It is tricky to ask her to take the job search seriously. I can do the math, and it would need her to sell 4000 soaps every month to make as much as she was making as a lawyer, and this number needs to go up because she can't make that many soaps all by herself, so it is definitely an uphill task. There is obvious marketing involved here, but other than that, there needs to be research and development to make this into a big and viable business; it can't stay
