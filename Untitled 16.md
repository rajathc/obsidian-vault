🗒️ **Your Last Conversation with Rajat: Task Management Feature Design Review** Here's a crisp recap to get you prepped for your next meeting with Rajat, Pri N: --- ## 🏗️ Core Discussion Themes - **Product Vision Split:** - You strongly preferred a task generation app that exports tasks (CSV/WhatsApp/email), not a standalone manager. - Rajat initially leaned toward a fully-featured in-app system for individuals. - **Why Export Wins for MVP:** - Type of user (ICP): already digitally active, likely uses some other task app. - Goal: Don’t create “yet another” to-do list. Instead, automate and streamline export to their current workflow. --- ## 🎯 UI/UX Decisions - **Swipe Interactions:** - Right-to-left swipe = mark as complete (easier for right-handed users). - Left-to-right swipe = offer "Delete" and "Mark Important". - Checkbox use: needs validation—potential confusion for less savvy users. - **Task Display Logic:** - Show tasks grouped as: Today → Yesterday → Older (collapsed). - Important tasks fixed at the top; completed ones move to bottom, but only after session ends to avoid jumping UI. - **Export Format:** - CSV via WhatsApp/email for easy sharing (title, description, due date, reference memory). - Markdown formatting as fallback for WhatsApp auto-formatting. --- ## 🔬 User Validation Points - Ask 5 users to test tap vs swipe vs checkbox. - See whether tasks are generally completed, deleted, or exported. - Monitor if users use screenshots instead of export/sharing. --- ## 🧩 Open Design Questions - **Churned User Experience:** - How do inactive users (returns after 2-3 weeks) handle accumulated tasks? - Make sure “Today/Yesterday/Older” makes their comeback manageable. - **Overflow Handling:** - What if users never complete/clear “Important” tasks? - Try to show only the top 5-6, with a “more” option to prevent an endless list. - **Groupings:** - Based on created date, as due dates are rare. - Possibility of user-controlled sort (date vs. importance). --- ## 🛠️ Implementation Touches - **Onboarding/Gesture Education:** - Animation for first few uses + tooltips on “Delete,” “Important,” “Done.” - Aim: reduce learning curve, especially for medium/low digital comfort users. - **Memory Reference:** - Every task links back to its source conversation/memory. --- ## 🤝 Key Points for Rajat - He’s tasked with prototyping these flows, validating user behavior. - Both of you agreed to push a “today/yesterday/older” grouping, then iterate based on data. - Open about shipping one design and watching real user behavior. --- 📌 **How to Go In:** - Ask him for the latest on the prototype/testing (which user feedback themes are emerging?). - Align if the export-first journey versus standalone task manager is still feeling “right” after trials. - Review if onboarding/tooltips need a tweak based on what’s most confusing for your specific ICP. --- **Your last call was full of granular debate on interaction details, user journeys, and release priorities—with both of you ready to adapt post-launch.** Meeting timestamp: 31st July 2025, 17:09 IST (Task Management Feature Design Review).
