Hey Priya,

I spoke to BH Prakash Reddy. He wanted ChatGPT integration because he often searches for suggestions after consultations. However, in the few times he tried Ask Neo, it either did not give him a response or showed that nothing was found from the memories. He said he needs some sort of functionality that can be proficient in medical knowledge. Right now, ChatGPT is doing that for him, which is why he wants to export the memories to ChatGPT. He also prefers ChatGPT for global treatment research, searching and reading new developments in medicine, and preparing material for paper presentations occasionally.

In his current workflow, he copies the summary and transcripts, then asks ChatGPT what better treatment he could have provided, and reviews the suggestions after the consultation. He followed something similar earlier, but at that time, he was also using ChatGPT on a laptop for transcription. This workflow has now been slightly inconvenient for him since it requires pasting the summary from the Neo app into WhatsApp, then copying it again to ChatGPT on his laptop. When I asked why he doesnâ€™t paste it directly into ChatGPT on his phone, he explained that he prefers the larger laptop screen as it is easier for him to read and type.

He also uses the device for public speaking. After a speech, he once asked Neo for suggestions on how to improve. Although he has only tried this once, he said that with Indic language support, he would use it more frequently for public speaking.

So far, he has not had repeat patients, so he has not been able to test the recall feature in real consultations. However, he has tried using Ask Neo for general queries, such as checking gold prices, finding stocks to invest but did not receive the results, so he prefers ChatGPT for those tasks as well. He frequently uses brainstorming with Neo for his non-medical work; he had no issues with that. 

He mainly uses the device in the clinic with patients and during career counselling sessions, usually with the device placed on the table. He is satisfied with the overall transcript and memory quality, except for the Indic language support. He also noted issues with entity recognition in Ask Neo and inaccuracies in its recall sometimes. For example, he told me about a conversation with a patient about returning in 25 days, but Ask Neo displayed it as 125 days, and he could not find the chat to show me.
