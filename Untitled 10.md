-The place I highly recommend trying to read at least for a little while is in that before you go to sleep. If you can read for just 15 minutes or before you go to sleep then you are well on your way reading again and it doesn't take a lot of extra planning. Just say up an next 15 minutes or go to bed 15 minutes earlier and you've done it. I read every night before I go to bed, sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes 30, sometimes an hour or 2 if the book is really good. I also sometimes were wake up early and for a 1 time I was getting up at 4AM just so that I had time to read, so I would be up all before the rest of my family, it would be nice and quite and I could read. That turned out that getting up at 4AM to read through off my sleeps get so much that living a little bit checkup, but I still like to get up early and read before I go inside busy dad. If you can it out that it is a day, reading search to be a habit become something you look forward to and it becomes a source of pleasure or if you are reading, you might worry that you are not going to be able to focus on much you read. If you if you are not used to reading, this is a real count. If you sit down, you open up a book, give me a few senses and think I wonder what's going on Twitter or on YouTube or you get a notification and suddenly your focus has been totally broken. This is a real count for most anyone in the modern world but is he solveable problem for most of us. We can train ourselves to focus for longer, simply buy reading. If we practice reading, wishes me reading after and you know paying attention to the reading, they won't be able to go along and longer without only needing to go off and do something else. Who will be able to simply enjoy reading and would be able to focus some more reading for long periods of time. That's the reason they can read is social media. If social media is the kind of thing that is getting in the way of reading, it is just about finding a way spend less time on social media. This can be difficult because algorithms and fees and websites are blind to be as addictive as possible and so it will be difficult to cut yourself off if you are used to being online all the time but this is something we have to do if we want to reclaim our lines and be able to think clearly and focus on what we think actually matters and if reading is something that actually matters to you, then me try to learn how much of studies and surveys that try to track reading habits across very large groups or at least only a handful that I could find. All of them seem to find 1 thing and that is that men are reading less than women. This is a trend that has started for a while and seems to be accelerateing. Sorry because he has decline the email reading license. I don't really love that phase and but it's what we have. At least there is a problem where a lot of men have just decided reading is not something that they should do. I really have been satisfied discussions on mail. But my friend Jek recently had a video where he thought about this and I thought he had some real insights, so I asked he would have on a call and we get have a problem.
