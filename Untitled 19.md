- Design part:
- Device state
- Day so far:
	- Updating metrics - Most frequently used words, Total time spent, Changes with each memory. The first thing to see below the device stage.
- 3-category repeat loop: 
	- Util based features(review my day upcoming tasks, ) not all of them go to ask neo
	- Emotion-based features, vibes board, takes to ask neo. who do you want to rate the score, mirror on the wall, relationship graph
	- Dynamic prompts- depend upon what we know about the user. 100s of memory, create a post, it is not fixed. can change based on the user. 
- The exact form or shape of the hook feature will change because the test will change. 

- Metrics don't make sense at this moment.
