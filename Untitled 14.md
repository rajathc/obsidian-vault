**Dear Apple App Review Team,**

Thank you for your review and the opportunity to clarify the use of background audio in our app. Below, we’ve addressed each of your questions and included a video demonstration as requested.

### **Neo 1 Wearable & App Mode**

Our core product is the **Neo 1 wearable** an AI-powered audio note-taking device that transcribes, summarises, and analyses conversations in real-time. 

**App Mode** in our iOS app acts as a **fallback option** for our users, designed for moments when:
- They **forget to carry their Neo 1 device**
- The device is **out of battery** and need to capture audio notes using their phone

App Mode provides the same core note-taking experience via the iPhone microphone, with full user control and transparency.
### **How the App Uses Background Audio**

Our app now includes an optional feature called **App Mode**, which enables background audio capture. This feature is designed to replicate the core functionality of our Neo 1 wearable device, specifically for users who rely on voice-first interaction and need to continue using the service when their hardware is not available.

- **App Mode is only activated manually** by the user through an explicit toggle inside the app.
- Once enabled, the app records and processes audio continuously in the background until the user disables it via:
    - An in-app control, or
    - The persistent recording notification.
- Audio is used exclusively to generate transcripts, summaries, and user-facing insights. No audio is stored without user intent.
### **Video Demonstration Provided**

We’ve attached a video demonstrating:
1. Manual activation of App Mode.
2. iOS’s native **orange recording indicator** (status bar).
3. Background recording while using other apps.
4. The persistent notification with stop control.
5. The **consent and permission request flow** prior to activation.
### **Privacy, Consent, and Indicators**
- **Consent Flow:** Before enabling App Mode, users are shown a clear description of what the feature does and must provide explicit permission.
- **iOS Orange Dot:** Always visible during recording as a built-in system indicator.
- **Persistent Notification:** Actively informs users that audio capture is running and includes an option to stop.
- **No background audio activation without user interaction.**
### **Privacy Policy & Data Handling**

Our in-app **Privacy Policy** (Settings > Privacy Policy) includes detailed information about:
- **App Permissions**: Why microphone and background access are required.
- **Data Collection & Use**: Audio is processed into transcripts and summaries; data is not sold or used for advertising.
- **User Controls**: Users can delete recordings, conversations, or their account data at any time.
- **Third-Party Services**: We use trusted service providers for speech processing and secure cloud storage, all subject to strict access controls.
- **Security Measures**: We apply encryption in transit and at rest, and restrict access to authorised personnel only.

We avoid collecting unnecessary data and provide clear controls to our users.
### Summary

App Mode is an accessibility-oriented feature that enables background audio processing **only when explicitly turned on by the user**. We’ve taken care to implement all necessary indicators, controls, and privacy safeguards according to Apple’s guidelines.
If you need anything else or require a different format for the video submission, please let us know.
