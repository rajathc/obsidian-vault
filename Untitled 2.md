1. Onboarding(mostly on product setup)
2. ⁠Doesn’t know how to access features or how to navigate in the app (voice profiling, where to find transcripts, how to copy transcripts and memories, etc)
3. ⁠Transcript is poor, due to glitchy audio on the iPhone (I verified it with his audio)
4. ⁠Memory hallucination, due to glitchy audio
5. ⁠Bluetooth range issues(he keeps the device on the desk and walks around the room in the meetings)
6. ⁠App not transcribing after a few hours (stuck state)
7. ⁠Poor battery and Battery inconsistency (this is due to him charging the device and keeping it in the bag for days)

No issues with the currently built, for the customers using the device right now
