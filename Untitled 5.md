Webhook and api - Something experimental
So that I can then run a customized workflow where I'll create a calendar blocking or something on from that conversation, maybe a task or something in Like Notion Docs or Google To Do's.

You would want to create a calendar, block the calendar, and integrate it with Notion and Google Calendar. Some task scheduling stuff like it can already tell the next step site. Just want to be synced with either Notion or some other place so that I can use other platforms and things.

Okay, yeah, makes sense. Like, actually, because we have some things like this in our pipeline as well, in addition to having a webhook and more integrations, because that's one of the more requested feature. About summaries being very small Yeah, so sometimes what's happening is like within the conversation it's creating summaries of one or two minutes Yeah and like the conversation is probably of 30 minutes Yeah but it splits the conversation between like and small sections are created for one or two minutes okay can you tell me when this happened yeah I will share you yeah short maybe Yeah and there was a merge feature also I tried that but it wasn't working I think okay the merge we fixed like we noticed it there was some issue which we have fixed okay okay yeah merge is now working like we it was down for like say for some time we managed to fix it okay okay yeah yeah I think that should be fine yeah and one minute yeah we can merge it back into the main thread yeah so I will tell you what happens like obviously I'm not supposed to give the entire detail say around after 20 seconds of silence around 20 second it starts generating the memory if it detects that I mean the reason why we try not to say is like people will be anxious that no I have to keep my speaking like that's why but if not that say obviously it's very frequent to have the 20 second pause even when you are talking to a friend so that's where you can just merge the memory and it works like a new memory in case if it's not there then yeah it splits into that because we were experimenting and we found out that no like pause more than like 20 to 30 seconds is usually a it's unusual or else what generally happens is a very long memory with multiple memories so we had to think of a pause so in case that happens just you can merge like now it won't break we have also ensured that if this breaks we will get an alert okay okay what language were you speaking in? English okay you had problems with Indy yeah sometimes the translation is misinterpreted do you think it is because the speaker is attributed wrongly or it's just hallucination okay translation is not correct in the summary yeah okay okay I'll look into it if possible can you share this memory with the one where it got split in two multiple place pieces? This is the same number I can send your text sure it was nice talking to you others like in case you have any other issues right you can also reach out to me in addition to DJ I work on I'm a product manager I work on mostly memory and transcription itself okay is there a possibility that I can get any API or anything like that? I mean we have to build it currently are what our plans are like full but it is on our priority like I think in a month we are focusing on integrations as well this month is mostly on improving the memory experience which devices for this yeah I showed this part up to my classmates yeah and so basically some customization can be written on top of it like because some automation tools are trending right yeah and then the other tools yeah so we can just synchronize this with something else yeah we can build some made custom tailored solutions yeah makes sense understood okay sure I understand let you know in the when we have any integrations I'll also discuss this with the team and update you sure okay others it was nice talking to you okay bye welcome bye
