As a Product Manager at NeoSapien, I am dedicated to driving innovation and delivering impactful solutions in the technology sector. With a postgraduate degree in Computational Chemistry from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, I bring a unique analytical perspective to product development. My entrepreneurial journey includes founding and leading a startup for two years, enriching my approach to problem-solving and innovation.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am passionate about infusing creativity into technology. I express this enthusiasm through my blog, where I explore topics ranging from product management and technology to travel and music. Traveling serves as my avenue for unwinding and gaining fresh insights, which I incorporate into my work. Additionally, I have a keen interest in indie rock music, reflecting my appreciation for creativity and innovation in various forms.

I am always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities at the intersection of technology and creativity.
